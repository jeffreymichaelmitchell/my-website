I am a sociologist and postdoctoral researcher at the [department of sociology at Umeå University](https://www.umu.se/en/department-of-sociology/) in Sweden. My research focuses on a broad range of topics including prejudice, trust in political institutions, and more recently the effects of social policies and policing. I am particularly interested in how social change occurs over time, both within individuals and across societies, using longitudinal quantitative methods.\
\
I am a part of two research groups: [The Evolution of Prejudice](https://www.umu.se/en/research/projects/the-evolution-of-prejudice/)and [The UmU Barometer](https://cors.se/en/umu-barometer/). My work has been published in a variety of international peer-reviewed journals including *European Sociological Review,* *Social Science & Medicine, Ethnic and Racial Studies*, *Frontiers in Sociology*, and *Socius: Sociological Research for a Dynamic World*.\
\
In addition to my research I teach courses on sociological theory, comparative social policy, quantitative methods (Master's level), and Open Science for the Social Sciences (PhD level).
