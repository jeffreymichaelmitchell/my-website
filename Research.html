<p>My research sits at the intersection of attitudes and the effects of
structural racism and discrimination in different societies. I defended
my PhD dissertation in 2020 with the title ’<em>Prejudice in contecxt
over time: how demographic, economic and social conditions influence
anti-immigrant attitudes in adolescents and adults’</em>. A full text of
the introductory chapter, known in Sweden as the <em>kappa</em>, can be
found <a
href="http://umu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1391008/FULLTEXT01.pdf">here.</a>
Since my defense, I have expanded my research to include political
trust, and the effects of policing on society. My work has been
published in various international peer-reviewed journals. Below I have
some short summaries of these publications (and preprints) with links to
the full texts.</p>

href="https://osf.io/9vdc5"><strong>Who Gets the Blame and Who Gets the
Credit? Policing, assistance, and political trust amongst the Roma in
Europe</strong></a>“. <em>Preprint</em><br />
Despite being Europe’s largest ethnic minority, there is strikingly
little systematic quantitative research on how experiences with the
police, and other government agencies are related to the trust that the
Roma place in political institutions. This study addresses this gap by
using EU-MIDIS II data to assess the relationship between institutional
trust and the experiences the Roma have with the police and assistance
programs.We show that different experiences relate to trust in
institutions differently: interactions with the police, either by being
stopped or assaulted are most strongly associated with lower trust in
the police and local government. In contrast, those who report having
received assistance based on their minority membership are associated
with modestly higher levels of trust across institution types. These
results are consistent across the countries included in the analysis,
and highlight the importance of institutional assistance and procedural
justice in fostering or eroding trust amongst minority populations.</p>

Level Associations Between Historical Residential Redlining and
Contemporary Fatal Encounters with the Police</a>” Social Science &amp;
Medicine.</strong><br />
How does structural racism influence where people are killed during
encounters with police? We analyzed geo-located incidents of fatal
encounters with police that occurred between 2000 and 2020 in Census
tracts that received a classification by the Home Owners Loan
Corporation (HOLC) during the 1930’s. Hierarchal Bayesian Negative
Binomial (HBNB) models show that incidents of fatal encounters with
police in formerly redlined areas are 66% more likely than in zones that
received the most favorable “A” rating. These differences remain even
when tract historical and contemporary racial compositions, along with
contemporary economic conditions, are taken into account. The effects of
contemporary racial composition and economic conditions overshadow the
effect of zone classifications only in areas with high proportions of
Black residents or residents in poverty (&gt;60% or &gt;30%
respectively). These findings provide evidence of structural biases in
policing rooted in historical segregation policies.</p>

are Trusted? How Context and Time Shape Immigrants’ Trust in the Police
in Europe</strong></a>” <strong>Ethnic and Racial
Studies.</strong><br />
In this study we examine first-generation immigrants’ trust in the
police in Europe from a comparative and longitudinal perspective. Based
on roughly 20,000 immigrants observed in 22 countries over 13 years in
the European Social Survey, results show that initially high levels of
trust in the police among immigrants tend to erode with the length of
their stay in the host country. We show that two simultaneous processes
drive this pattern: a fading reference effect (downward assimilation)
and an increasing discrimination effect. Cross-national comparisons show
that, on average, immigrants in countries with more police trust the
police less. However, there is no effect of police size within
countries, mostly because police numbers hardly change over time. We
discuss implications for future research and policy development based on
our findings.</p>

I Was Growing Up: The Lasting Impact of Immigrant Presence on
Native-Born American Attitudes towards Immigrants and
Immigration.</strong></a><strong>“</strong> <strong>European
Sociological Review.</strong><br />
Scholarship, including seminal research on prejudice, identifies
adolescence as a critical period for the development of attitudes. Yet
most sociological research on prejudice, especially in the form of
anti-immigrant sentiment, focuses on the relationship between
contemporaneous social conditions and attitudes towards out-groups while
neglecting the demographic context during one’s impressionable years.
Therefore, we design research to investigate the relationship among
temporally distal and temporally proximal sub-national contexts and
native-born attitudes towards immigration and immigrants. To do this, we
merge geocoded data from the General Social Survey (1994–2016) with a
unique US state-level dataset (1900–2015). Results from multilevel
models reveal that immigrant presence during adolescence is a more
consistent predictor of attitudes towards immigration and immigrants in
adulthood. Thus, while the majority of sociological research on
anti-immigrant sentiment asks <em>if</em> societal conditions matter,
our results suggest that a more important question is <em>when</em> the
context matters.</p>

Trust and Anti-Immigrant Attitudes in Europe: A Longitudinal Multi-Level
Analysis</strong></a><strong>.</strong>” <strong>Frontiers in
Sociology.</strong><br />
Research investigating how social conditions influence attitudes about
immigrants has focused primarily on demographic and economic factors as
potential threat inducing contexts that lead to anti-immigrant
sentiment. However, the empirical evidence supporting this link is
mixed, while social cohesion indicators such as the influence of social
trust, have largely been left unexamined. This article uses the European
Social Survey (2002–2016) to test how differences in social trust, both
within and between countries influence attitudes about immigrants.
Results from longitudinal analyses show that countries with higher
levels of social trust have more favorable attitudes toward immigrants,
and while changes in social trust over time are small, they result in
comparably large changes in anti-immigrant attitudes, even when
controlling for other social factors. These results are robust across
different model specifications and data sources.</p>

and Change: A Longitudinal Analysis of Attitudes about Immigrants in
Adolescence</strong></a>.” <strong>Socius: Sociological Research for a
Dynamic World</strong><br />
Research has explored many different relationships between contextual
influences, such as levels of immigration or economic condition, and
attitudes about immigrants, with mixed results. These have largely been
international comparative studies using cross-sectional data, therefore
they have been unable to make claims about changes in environmental
context translating to changes in attitudes of respondents. Furthermore,
the previous literature has almost exclusively tested these
relationships using data from adults, despite research showing that
attitudes are most subject to change during adolescence. This study
addresses these issues by using a longitudinal data set of repeated
measures of 2,328 German adolescents (about 14–18 years old) over four
response waves (2010–2014). Using a multilevel analysis, results show
that contextual changes, including the percentage of foreign-born people
and unemployment rates within respondents’ states, correspond to changes
in attitudes toward immigrants consistent with group threat theory.
These results were stable even when controlling individual-level
factors.</p>
<p><strong>Mitchell, Jeffrey. 2019.</strong> “<a
href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01419870.2018.1493209"><strong>Prejudice
in the Classroom: A Longitudinal Analysis of Anti-Immigrant
Attitudes</strong></a><strong>.</strong>” <strong>Ethnic and Racial
Studies</strong>.<br />
This article analyses how the classroom context contributes to attitude
change in adolescence. By analysing the relationship that the primary
school classroom context has on anti-immigrant attitudes over time, it
addresses the single factor fallacy that has troubled previous research
on classrooms, which has largely tested the contact hypothesis. The
dataset includes 849 participants over five-time points from 2010 to
2015. Findings show that over time individual’s anti-immigrant attitudes
increased in classrooms with a higher average level of anti-immigrant
sentiment net of the effect of classroom heterogeneity. However, this
finding was true only while students were still enrolled in the same
class over the first three waves of the study. After students entered
high school, the classroom/time interaction effect disappears,
suggesting that other contextual influences take over. This article
highlights the crucial importance of classroom context on attitude
development in adolescence.</p>
